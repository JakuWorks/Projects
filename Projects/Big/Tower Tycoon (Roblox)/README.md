## Short Description:
It was my first big project ever! <br>
During the first period could only work 1/2 the time I wanted, at uncomfortable hours and in a bad environment. It was because I had to share my PC with someone else who would used it all the time.

The second period was when I got a laptop, had lots of time to work, and was not locked in a small room with that person.
