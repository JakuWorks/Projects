**Backups** are files with names such as: "1", "2", "3" and "10"<br>
**Releases** are files with names such as: "11 (Release 1.0)".<br>
Numbers at the beginning of file names tell which release/backup is the newest. The higher the number is, the newer the version of the game.<br>
Though it is NOT recommended to download backups instead of releases if You want to have a working program. Backups generally contain way more errors.<br>
Releases like: "1.0", "2.0" and "3.19" are NOT connected with the numbers at the beginning of file names. "Release 1.0", "Release 2.0" and so on are simply used for organization purposes.

More backups are stored at this Place's Configuration website (at Roblox).<br>
