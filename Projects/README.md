# Overview
The projects sorted by size: 
- `Big` projects - take over a few months to complete
- `Small` projects - take a few days/weeks to complete


# Project Prefixes
- `Nothing` (no Prefix) - The project is completed and operational.
- `(W.I.P.)` - Work in Progress. <br>
  - Note: UNLESS STATED OTHERWISE. The W.I.P. prefix projects might have the following folders:
    - `W.I.P.` - I use this folder as my Workspace, so the project probably won't run because of uncompleted code.
    - `LatestWorkingRelease` - This is the folder with the latest working release of the project that works.
- `(EXP)` (Expanding Archive) - This is a folder/archive of small, similar and often one-file projects.
