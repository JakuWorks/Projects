# Overview
The projects were sorted by size: 
- `Big` projects - took/will take over a few months to complete
- `Small` projects - took/will take a few days/weeks to complete

The `TestingAndDump` folder contains short tests I made to quickly check a small concept &nbsp;&nbsp;it also contains really small projects that got trashed in an early stage, that I didn't want to just delete.

# Project Prefixes
- `Nothing` (no Prefix) - This means that the project is completed
- `(UNF)` (Unfinished and Abandoned) - This means that the project is ABANDONED, UNFINISHED and DOES NOT WORK.
- `(W.I.P.)` (Work in Progress) - This means that the project isn't yet finished BUT ALSO isn't abandoned.
    `Note: UNLESS STATED OTHERWISE. The W.I.P. projects may have "LatestWorkingRelease" and "W.I.P." folders. If there are no such folders, then the project is likely, not functional.`
- `(EXP)` (Expanding Archive) - This is a folder/archive of small, similar and often one-file projects. TIP: To find the biggest projects in EXPs, sort them by size.
