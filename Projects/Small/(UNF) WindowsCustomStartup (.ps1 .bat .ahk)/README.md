## Short Description:

:warning: **THIS PROJECT IS UNFINISHED, ABANDONED AND DOESN'T WORK!!!** :warning:

Around 15.01.2023 I got a new laptop and I wanted to 'set it up' really well. <br>
One time I made my own Windows autostart (background) program - an AutoHotkey script with custom hotkeys. <br>
Then I thought - why not I'd create my own 'downloader' for it and why not I'd do it in PowerShell Script to learn a new language? <br>
Then because I had very little time (school, learning for exams) I had to stop working on it and leave it unfinished, just to abandon this project a few months after.
