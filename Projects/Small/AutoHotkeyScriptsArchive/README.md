# Project Summary:


## Used Coding Languages:
- **AutoHotkey Script** (mainly v2.0) (.ahk)


<br>


## Noteworthy Skills I've Learned:
- Making and using AutoHotkey scripts to save time and automate tasks.


<br>


## Other Information:
- I started documenting these scripts on  **28.04.2023**.
- I doubt I'll ever consider this 'project' 'completed', because of its nature


<br>


## Short Description:
AutoHotkey is really useful to me, I sometimes automate simple tasks using AutoHotkey Scripts.<br>
Before I started documenting them, I already made many short AutoHotkey scripts, I started 'officially' learning AutoHotkey about 01.10.2022 (a few months before Christmas), though I knew about AutoHotkey many years before that.
