# Overview
I'm a Young Polish Male self-taught programmist. I'm intense with my Self-Improvement, though there's still lots to do and improve on. <br>
While coding, I usually make projects of various sizes. Surprisingly! I tend to store/make them in this repository...<br>

This repository was created about **14.04.2023 at 17:42 GMT+2** (though I started making it a few hours/days earlier).<br>
This repository may also be called an archive because there are also archived projects stored in it.


>### I created this repository to easily document, organize and create my projects in one place, also to give my new projects a good backbone, a good starting point and to reduce chaos.

# About Me:


## My story in a nutshell:

### Before Self-Improvement (my life was trash back then):
 - **~\~01.06.2021** - Getting into coding (not officially), mainly by learning about Roblox exploiting and using the Source Engine Games' Console.
  
 - **22.05.2022** - Out of boredom, I started making a Roblox tycoon game (my first project).

### After starting Self-Improvement:
 - **~10.06.2022** - **Officially started learning to code** and **the beginning of my Self-Improvement** <sub>*(my Self-Improvement journey began after I read a comment on some forum that Hamza is a great self-improvement YouTuber; I started watching Hamza and it all started...; bless the person who wrote that comment).*</sub>
  
 - **Time in between** - Making more projects, getting more intense with Self-Improvement.
  
 - **14.04.2023** - Created this repository.
