# Overview
While coding, I usually make projects of various sizes. Surprisingly! I tend to store/make them in this repository...<br>

This repository was created about 14.04.2023 at 17:42 GMT+2 (though I started making it a few hours/days earlier).<br>
This repository may also be called an archive because there are also archived projects stored in it.


<br>


# Project Prefixes
- (UNF) (Unfinished and Abandoned) - This means that the project is ABANDONED, UNFINISHED and DOES NOT WORK.
- (W.I.P) (Work in Progress) - This means that the project isn't yet finished BUT ALSO isn't abandoned.
- (EXP) (Expanding Archive) - This is a folder/archive of small, similar and often one-file projects. TIP: To find the biggest projects in EXPs, sort them by size.
