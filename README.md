# Overview
>### I created this repository to easily document, organize and create my projects in one place, also to give my new projects a good backbone, a good starting point and to reduce chaos.

I'm a Young Polish Male self-taught programmer. I'm on intense Self-Improvement. <br>
While coding, I usually make projects of various sizes. Surprisingly! I tend to store/make them in this repository...<br>

This repository was created about **14.04.2023 at 17:42 GMT+2** (though I started making it a few hours/days earlier).<br>
This repository may also be called an archive because there are also archived projects stored in it.

## Current Status (updated on 08.06.2023): I have much free time. I'm working on this repo.

# Notes
- **TO VIEW THE PROJECTS, GO INTO THE "Projects" FOLDER IN GITHUB**
- I don't know a way to download a single project, I recommend downloading this entire repository.
- Unless stated otherwise, I expect all projects to be run on a Windows 10/11 machine.
- There are lots of README files explaining many things
- ~XYZ means **around** XYZ
- ~\~XYZ means **really around** XYZ
- All dates and times are in the **GMT+2** timezone unless stated otherwise.
- All READMEs, etc. use the `DD.MM.YY` date format and `MM⠆HH` or `MM⠆HH⠆SS` time format unless stated otherwise.
- ~90% of dates in all READMEs, etc. are approximate and the ones that have already passed before creating this repo <sub>for example the before self-improvement about me</sub> can be wrong by over a few months. 
- In READMEs the [] are placeholders
- My time is precious. After doing simple edits to the projects, I may not change their description (i.e. lines of code number).

# About Me:


## My story in a nutshell:

### Before Self-Improvement (my life was trash back then):
 - **~\~01.06.2021** - Getting into coding (not officially), mainly by learning about Roblox exploiting and using the Source Engine Games' Console.
  
 - **22.05.2022** - Out of boredom, I started making a Roblox tycoon game (my first project).

### After starting Self-Improvement:
 - **~10.06.2022** - **Officially started learning to code** and **the beginning of my Self-Improvement** <sub>*(my Self-Improvement journey began after I read a comment on some forum that Hamza is a great self-improvement YouTuber; I started watching Hamza and it all started...; bless the person who wrote that comment).*</sub>
  
 - **Time in between** - Making more projects, getting more intense with Self-Improvement.
  
 - **14.04.2023** - Created this repository.
