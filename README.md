# Overview
While coding, I usually make projects of various sizes. Surprisingly! I tend to store/make them in this repository...<br>

This repository was created about 14.04.2023 at 17:42 GMT+2 (though I started making it a few hours/days earlier).<br>
This repository may also be called an archive because there are also archived projects stored in it.

>### I created this repository to easily document, organize and create my projects in one place, also to give my new projects a good backbone, a good starting point and reduce chaos.

# Project Prefixes
- (UNF) (Unfinished and Abandoned) - This means that the project is ABANDONED, UNFINISHED and DOES NOT WORK.
- (W.I.P) (Work in Progress) - This means that the project isn't yet finished BUT ALSO isn't abandoned.
- (EXP) (Expanding Archive) - This is a folder/archive of small, similar and often one-file projects. TIP: To find the biggest projects in EXPs, sort them by size.

# Notes
- ~XYZ means **around** XYZ
- ~\~XYZ means **really around** XYZ &nbsp; <sub>`NOTE: In raw markdown (.md) text, use ~\~ instead, to not accidentally trigger the strikethrough formatting`</sub>
- All dates and times are in the GMT+2 timezone unless stated otherwise.
- All READMEs, etc. use the DD.MM.YY date format and MM⠆HH or MM⠆HH⠆SS time format unless stated otherwise.
- ~90% of dates in all READMEs, etc. are approximate and some can be even wrong by over a few months.
- In READMEs the [] are placeholders
- After doing simple edits to the projects, I may not change its description (i.e. lines of code number), be warned

# About Me:


## My short story and important Self-Image changes:

### Before Self-Improvement (my life was trash back then):
 - **~\~01.06.2021** - Getting into coding (not officially), mainly by learning about Roblox exploiting and using the Source Engine Games' Console.
 - **22.05.2022** - Out of boredom, I started making a Roblox tycoon game.

### After starting Self-Improvement:
 - **~10.06.2022** - **Officially started learning to code** and **the beginning of my Self-Improvement** *(my self-improvement began after I read a comment on some forum that Hamza is a great self-improvement YouTuber, I started watching Hamza and it all started...; bless the person who wrote that comment).*
 - **The time in between the above and the below entry** - Making more projects, getting more intense with Self-Improvement.
 - **14.04.2023** - Created this repository to archive, document and organize my projects, make new projects have a good 'backbone' and learn the basics of Git and GitHub.
 - **03.05.2023** - I'm a Young Polish Male self-taught programmist. I'm intense with my self-improvement, though there's still lots to do and improve on.
