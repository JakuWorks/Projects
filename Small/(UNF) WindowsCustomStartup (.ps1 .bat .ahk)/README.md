Short Description:
    THIS PROJECT IS UNFINISHED, ABANDONED AND DOESN'T WORK

    I got a new laptop and I wanted to 'set it up'. One time I made my own autostart (with custom hotkeys) and thought - why not I create my own 'downloader' for it and why not I do it in PowerShell Script?
    Then because I had very little time (school, exams) I had to stop working on it and leave it unfinished, to abandon this project a few months after.
