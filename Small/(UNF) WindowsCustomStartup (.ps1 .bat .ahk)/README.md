## Short Description:

**THIS PROJECT IS UNFINISHED, ABANDONED AND DOESN'T WORK**
Around 01.01.2023 I got a new laptop and I wanted to 'set it up'. One time I made my own Windows autostart (background) program - an AutoHotkey script with custom hotkeys. Then I thought - why not I'd create my own 'downloader' for it and why not I'd do it in PowerShell Script to learn a new language? <br>
Then because I had very little time (school, learning for exams) I had to stop working on it and leave it unfinished, just to abandon this project a few months after.
