Used Coding Languages:
    - AutoHotkey (mainly v2.0)

Other information
    I started documenting these scripts on:  28.04.2023 around 15:30
    I doubt I'll ever consider this 'project' completed
    It has [unknown] lines of code!


Short Description:
    AutoHotkey is really useful and just I can't stop making these from time to time.

    Before I started documenting them, I already made many short AutoHotkey scripts, I started officially learning AutoHotkey about 01.10.2022, though I knew about AutoHotkey many years before that.
